    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken parmesan, or chicken parmigiana, is a dish that consists of breaded
        chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or
        bacon is sometimes added.</p>

    <p>The dish originated in the Italian diaspora in the United States during the early 20th century. It
        has been speculated that the dish is based on a combination of the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, a dish using
        fried eggplant slices and tomato sauce, with a cotoletta, a breaded veal cutlet generally served without sauce
        or cheese in Italy.</p>

    <p>Chicken parmesan is included as the base of a number of different meals, including sandwiches and pies,
        and the meal is used as the subject of eating contests at some restaurants.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until
            fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, wine, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
            Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine, reduce the
            heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Keep warm until
            needed.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rigatoni and cook,
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
        <li>At the same time, start the chicken: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
            sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Set out three large mixing bowls for breading chicken. Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4
            teaspoon salt, and pepper in the first bowl. Whisk together eggs and milk in the second bowl. Combine bread
            crumbs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in
            the third bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and flatten with a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
            Dredge a chicken breast in flour mixture and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread
            crumb mixture. Place onto a plate. Repeat to bread remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Fill a large, cast iron skillet with 1 inch oil; heat over medium-high heat until oil is hot but not
            smoking. Add breaded chicken in batches; cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken
            to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and
            the cheeses have melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Plate pasta portions. Stir basil into sauce and ladle over pasta. Top each portion with chicken.</li>
